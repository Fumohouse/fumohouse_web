## Community Standards

As a community member, the following is expected of you:

1. Be respectful to others unless provoked,
2. Understand and accept the differences between you and your peers/other community members,
3. Strive for improvement, and
4. Have fun

The following behavior is considered unacceptable:

1. Discriminatory behavior or remarks with respect to one's race, sex, gender, identity, nationality, religion, etc.,
2. Breach of privacy of other community members,
3. Inappropriate behavior or remarks,
4. Intentionally or recklessly publishing information which is false,
5. Unprovoked/inappropriate references to or comments about current events or contentious political topics, and
6. Any other behavior which contradicts core values of the project or its community to an unreasonable level.

### Scope

The code of conduct applies to all members of Fumohouse, and in all situations where a member is representing or contributing to Fumohouse.
It may apply in rare cases to a member's private conduct or their public or off-platform behavior.

### Violations

Violations of this code of conduct can be reported privately via Discord or via e-mail to `fumohouse [at] pm.me`.
Your report may be discussed with trusted community members and the accused (to whatever level of detail comfortable). If there are reasonable doubts about your claims, a decision may take longer than expected, and punishment may be impossible.

### Enforcement

Enforcement will be decided on a per-case basis.

Context and precedent will be considered, but previous precedent may be overridden if necessary (in this case, enforcement will be less harsh).

### Changes

Changes to this code can be made at any time, as indicated by the modify date of this page.

Added policies will not be applied retroactively.
Removal of policies will.
