This page lays out a few guidelines about your contributions to Fumohouse -
options which you have, and things which have been decided for you.
You should read and understand the contents of this page which apply to you,
and ask questions if you need to.

If you do not agree with any part of this page, you should contact me about it.
In the meantime, you should not submit your contribution.

## For all contributions

1. You are still expected to follow the rules.
2. You agree that your contribution will remain in version history (i.e. Git) **forever**,
and that you cannot request your contribution to be erased from history.
3. You agree that you will be listed in the credits for as long as your contribution remains in the latest release of the game, but not necessarily any longer.
4. You agree that requests to have your contribution removed from the game might not be honored until an adequate replacement is found.
5. You agree that there are no guarantees for compensation for your work outside of attribution.
6. **You must declare if you have used outside work in your contribution** - who made it and under what license.
Failure to do so can result in removal of your contribution, or suspension of your account.
    - If you don't have the rights, **don't use it.**
7. Your contribution and credits may be removed if you egregiously violate the rules.

## For assets (3D models, art, etc.)

1. If your asset is created specifically for Fumohouse, you are strongly urged to license it under
[CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), which all other assets are licensed under.
    - Understand that this license is irrevocable.
2. You may request an alternate license, but doing so could cause your contribution to be delayed or rejected.
3. Whenever possible, you should submit project files instead of exported assets, unless you use a paid program to work (in this case, submit both).
4. If you have a Github account, you should send your commit email or no-reply email for use in a co-author message.

## For code

1. You must license your code under MIT.
2. You should stick to the quality standards set out by the rest of the codebase. If you do not follow appropriate conventions, your contribution will be rejected.
3. You should submit your contribution via Pull Request.
